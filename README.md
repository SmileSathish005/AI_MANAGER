Core idea to analyze the traffic data by processing the cctv video frames using opencv-yolo(v8) ML model & adjusting  traffic light timings dynamically using microcontroller
The repository contains the YOLOv8  real-time object detection model developed by Ultralytics trained on
coco dataset used to detect vehicles in images and videos.
